# Pandas .head() to .tail()

Materials for my [O'Reilly Live Online Training course](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/)

## First-Time Setup

1. [Install Miniconda for your platform](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) ([instructions](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html))
  + If you already have conda, you can skip this step; It's also fine to use virtualenv + pip,
    just make sure to install all the python packages in `environment.yml`
  + Make sure to open a new terminal shell after installing, so that `conda` is on your path
2. Clone the repository at https://github.com/tomaugspurger/pandas-head-to-tail
  - `git clone https://github.com/tomaugspurger/pandas-head-to-tail`
3. Change into the repository
  - `cd pandas-head-to-tail`
4. Create the conda environment
  - `conda env create`
5. Activate the environment
  - `source activate ph2t` on Linux or MacOS
  - `activate ph2t` on Windows
6. Start the Jupyter notebook server
  - `jupyter notebook`

## Notebooks

Once your notebook server is running, (`jupyter notebook`) your browser should open up to the webpage (`http://localhost:8888` by default).
Open the notebook `00-README.ipynb` and familiarize yourself with using notebook.
